                In a 2007 episode of the SBS variety show Amazing Contest Star King, Baek performed "Listen" by Beyoncé and was labeled a "contemporary R&B genius". Baek Yerin, who appeared on the stage as a "10-year-old ballad genius", surprised the cast and viewers. After her Star King appearance, Baek decided to audition for JYP Entertainment. She spent five years (2007–2012) training in South Korea and the United States, and was called a "genius girl" for her vocal talent, skills in using the piano and fluency in the English language.
                On September 27, 2012, JYP revealed Baek would debut as part of a duo along with Park Ji-min called 15&. On October 7, the duo debuted with their first single, "I Dream", on SBS Inkigayo. The duo began a four-year hiatus in February 2015 and disbanded following Park's departure from JYP Entertainment.

            <p class="double-space" id="p2" style="padding-top: 6%">
                In 2015, she planned a solo album for the music style she pursued and met Cloud, a producer of CHEEZE. At the first meeting, Baek Yerin did not know Cloud, but he said that he was a fan of Baek Yerin, and later he was able to meet her with the introduction of his agency. In November 2015, Baek debuted as a solo artist with her first extended play, Frank, with the lead single titled "Across the Universe". The lead song's lyrics were inspired by the film The Martian.
                Baek released her first digital single titled Bye Bye My Blue on June 20, 2016. Her follow-up digital single titled Love You on Christmas was released on December 7.

            <p class="double-space" id="p2" style="padding-top: 6%">
                As Baek continued to feature on songs by popular artists, she also began performing covers and her own unreleased songs at festivals.

The Seoul-based rock band consists of vocalist and guitarist Baek, bassist Hyungseok Koh, guitarist Jonny, and drummer Chiheon Kim. Like the majority of Baek's post-JYP solo work, The Volunteer's lyrics are written entirely in English.

            <p class="double-space" id="p2" style="padding-top: 6%">
                Baek officially launched her own label, Blue Vinyl, on November 6, and on November 22 she released her first single through the label, "Popo (How Deep Is Your Love)". In the build up to Baek's new album, it was revealed that songs which had previously been released on her SoundCloud would feature on the new release, as well as new, never-heard-before tracks.

As well as "Square (2017)" finding success, the album also topped charts in South Korea.

                In February 2020, her first solo concert, "Turn on that Blue Vinyl", was a success. As tickets for about 4,400 seats were sold out in 30 seconds, it is an example of how Baek Yerin's reputation is clearly different from before.
                On December 10, 2020, exactly one year after her previous album, Baek Yerin released her second studio album <i>tellusboutyourself,</i> consisting of 14 tracks. The first single "0415" also came with a music video on the same day. Overall 5 music videos ("0415", "Hate You", "I'll be your family!", "I'm in love", and "You're so lonely now, so you need me back by your side again") were released along with the album. The album features a both a wider range of musical genres and lyrical themes than her previous work.
                On February 16, 2021, Baek released <i>tellusboutyourself, (remixes),</i> a digital EP featuring 6 remixed tracks.
                Her band The Volunteers launched their self-titled debut album under Blue Vinyl on May 27, 2021 after previously making their music solely available through SoundCloud and YouTube. The album draws influence from rock acts such as Oasis, Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Beatles, while sonically channelling "a sense of rebellion".
                On September 10, 2021, Baek released the cover album Love, Yerin, featuring 6 remake tracks.

            <h5>Artistry and Reception</h5>
            <p class="double-space" id="p2" style="padding-top: 6%">
                Baek has cited Amy Winehouse, Oasis, Avril Lavigne, Rage Against the Machine, as well as Korean artists BoA, Light & Salt, and Yoo Jae Ha among her many varied influences. She named her first album as a solo artist, Frank, as a tribute to Amy Winehouse, whose debut album shared the same name.
                On her decision to write most of her recent songs in English, Baek explains her intentions as wanting to make her music accessible to international fans, plans for an international tour, and the influence English-language artists have had on her style and music. In a 2021 interview she mentioned that it is her dream to perform in the home countries of the many western artists that inspired her.
                Whether in English or Korean, Baek is known for her candid and straightforward lyrics. On her lyrical inspiration for her most recent album, Baek cites the poetic metaphors of Blossom Dearie and the straightforward style of Amy Winehouse as influences.
